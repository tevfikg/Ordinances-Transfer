# 🚗 VIP Transfer Project

This is a web-based platform I'm building to handle **VIP and luxury transfer bookings**. I wanted to create something that feels premium but stays fast and functional.

It’s currently live and hosted on **Vercel** here: [ordinances-transfer.vercel.app](https://ordinances-transfer.vercel.app/)

### 🛠 The Tech & Current State
This is a **Vanilla JS** project. I’m keeping it lightweight and fast while ensuring the frontend is fully responsive, since most users book these services on the go. Right now, it’s an **open-source** base that I’m actively refining.

### 🚀 What’s coming next?
I’m far from done with this one. My immediate roadmap includes:

* **Dynamic Booking Logic:** Making the reservation flow more interactive.
* **Premium UI/UX:** Polishing the design to really hit that "luxury" feel.
* **Backend Integration:** Setting up a robust system for managing reservations.

### 💡 Open Source & Feedback
Since this is an open-source project, feel free to poke around the code or give me feedback. It’s a work in progress, and I’ll be pushing updates to the Vercel deployment pretty frequently.
